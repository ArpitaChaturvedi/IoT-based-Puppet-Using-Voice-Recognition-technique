# IoT-based-Puppet-Using-Voice-Recognition-technique
Generally, it has been seen that a play or a puppet
show as a part of children’s learning activity has been
shown to contribute positively to a child’s physical, social,
emotional, and cognitive growth.
Puppet is a technology-based play tool that could be
incorporated in early childhood education.A survey of
state of art shows puppets being robotized.There are
several forms of puppets which are widely and frequently
used nowadays, most notably marionette, rod
and glove puppet etc.
This project aims at building a puppet which can be controlled
using voice-recognition technique.

Robots (a puppet is also a kind of a robot) can not perform
functions or operations on their own.They always
require a human interruption. In our case, we are using
voice-recognition technique to provide voice commands
to the puppet. Any person (IT or non-IT) can
easily use this puppet using voice commands without
having any kind of professional knowledge. In this project
we are discussing about a puppet with hinged body
parts which are controlled by servo motors which produces
required movements in the puppet related to the
given commands.The main objective of this paper is to
build a simple as well as an interactive multipurpose
puppet. The user sends the voice command through the
android phone to the arduino. Arduino then decodes
the command. After decoding, it processes the required
output in puppet (body movement).
